<INSTRUCTIONS>

    Your job is to identify the SYMBOLS while may need to be used or changed while implementing the TASK-DESCRIPTION below.
    Do NOT implement the TASK-DESCRIPTION, your job is limited only to identifying the relevant SYMBOLS.

    A relevant symbol is one of:
    - Namespace
    - Interface
    - Class
    - Struct
    - Record
    - Method
    - Member variable
    - Local variable

    Identify only SYMBOLS with meaningful names, e.g. ignore anything too short and generic like `i` or `j`.

    Your RESPONSE must be JSON according to this schema:

    ```jsonschema
    {{ schema }}
    ```

    The `symbols` field must contain the names of the relevant SYMBOLS in any order.

    EXCLUDE all the C# language, .NET Core, LINQ and standard library types, class, interface, function
    and member variable names, like `IEnumerable`, `null` and others. We want only the names of the symbols
    which are specific to the solution at hand and can be changed by the developer of the solution.

    Please ALWAYS honor ALL of these rules specific to your current job:
    - Do NOT come up with any new SYMBOLS, only use the ones mentioned in the TASK-DESCRIPTION.
    - Do NOT implement the TASK-DESCRIPTION, only extract the relevant SYMBOLS.
