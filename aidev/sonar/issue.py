    CleanCodeAttribute.CONVENTIONAL: "The code performs tasks with expected instructions. Faced with equally good options, the code adheres to a single choice across all instances, preferring language conventions. This includes using the appropriate programming interfaces and language features.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.IDENTIFIABLE: "The names follow a regular structure based on language conventions. The casing, word separators, suffixes, and prefixes used in the identifiers have purpose, without arbitrary differences.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.CLEAR: "The code is self-explanatory, transparently communicating its functionality. It is written in a straightforward way that minimizes ambiguity, avoiding unnecessary clever or intricate solutions.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.LOGICAL: "The code has well-formed and sound instructions that work together. It is free of explicit errors, contradictions, and commands that could be unpredictable or objectionable.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.COMPLETE: "The code constructs are comprehensive, used adequately and thoroughly. The code is functional and achieves its implied goals. There are no obviously incomplete or lacking solutions.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.EFFICIENT: "The code utilizes resources without needless waste. It prioritizes economical options when available, avoiding unnecessary consumption of memory, processor, disk, or network resources.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.FOCUSED: "The code has a single, narrow, and specific scope. Each unit should have only one concise purpose, without an overwhelming accumulation of instructions or excessive amounts of complexity.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.DISTINCT: "The code procedures and data are unique and distinctive, without undue duplication. The codebase has no significant repetition where it could be decomposed into smaller shared segments.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.MODULAR: "The code has been organized and distributed to emphasize the separation between its parts. The relationships within the code are carefully managed, ensuring they are minimal and clearly defined.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.TESTED: "The code has automated checks that provide confidence in the functionality. It has enough test coverage which enables changes in implementation without the risk of functional regressions.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.LAWFUL: "The code respects licensing and copyright regulation. It exercises the creatorâ€™s rights and honors otherâ€™s rights to license their own code.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.TRUSTWORTHY: "The code abstains from revealing or hard-coding private information. It preserves sensitive private information such as credentials and personally-identifying information.",
    CleanCodeAttribute.RESPECTFUL: "The code refrains from using discriminatory and offensive language. It chooses to prioritize inclusive terminology whenever an alternative exists that conveys the same meaning.",
